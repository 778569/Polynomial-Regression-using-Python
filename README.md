# Steps

In the document all steps and reasons included

   1.	Generate a Random data
   2.	Plot the data and check how it look like<br><br>

   3.	Split the data in to 3 potions
   4.	1st go with degree one Regression
   5.	Increased one degree (2nd degree) – Polynomial Regression
   6.	Model degree increasing to 3
   7.	Model degree increasing to 20
   8.	Now plot the models <br><br>

* Blue – Degree 1(under fitting, not fitting the data)
* Green = degree 2 (at the end it is not fitting to the data)
* Black  - degree 3 (good model)
